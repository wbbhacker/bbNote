#### 1.默认为服务端组件

Pages are [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials) by default but can be set to a [Client Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#client-components).

- Layouts in a route are **nested** by default. Each parent layout wraps child layouts below it using the React `children` prop.
- You can use [Route Groups](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups) to opt specific route segments in and out of shared layouts.
- Layouts are [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials) by default but can be set to a [Client Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#client-components).
- Layouts can fetch data.
- Passing data between a parent layout and its children is not possible. However, you can fetch the same data in a route more than once, and React will [automatically dedupe the requests](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching#automatic-fetch-request-deduping) without affecting performance.
- Layouts do not have access to the current route segment(s). To access route segments, you can use [`useSelectedLayoutSegment`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-selected-layout-segment) or [`useSelectedLayoutSegments`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-selected-layout-segments) in a Client Component.

#### 2.[Root Layout (Required)](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#root-layout-required)

- You can use the [built-in SEO support](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata) to manage `<head>` HTML elements, for example, the `<title>` element.
- You can use [route groups](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups) to create multiple root layouts. See an [example here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups#creating-multiple-root-layouts).
- The root layout is a [Server Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials) by default and **can not** be set to a [Client Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#client-components).

#### 5.[Modifying `<head>`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#modifying-head)

In the `app` directory, you can modify the `<head>` HTML elements such as `title` and `meta` using the [built-in SEO support](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata).
