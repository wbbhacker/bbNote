### [1.Data Fetching, Caching, and Revalidating](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating)

There are three main ways you can fetch data:

1. On the server, with the `fetch` API.
2. On the server, with third-party libraries.
3. On the client, with third-party libraries.

#### 1.[Fetching Data on the Server with `fetch`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#fetching-data-on-the-server-with-fetch)

- To use `async`/`await` in a Server Component with TypeScript, you'll need to use TypeScript `5.1.3` or higher and `@types/react` `18.2.8` or higher.

##### 1.[Caching Data](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#caching-data)

`fetch` requests that use the `POST` method are also automatically cached. Unless it's inside a [Route Handler](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) that uses the `POST` method, then it will not be cached.

##### 2.[Revalidating Data](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#revalidating-data)

Revalidation is the process of purging the Data Cache and re-fetching the latest data. This is useful when your data changes and you want to ensure you show the latest information.

Cached data can be revalidated in two ways:

- **Time-based revalidation**: Automatically revalidate data after a certain amount of time has passed. This is useful for data that changes infrequently and freshness is not as critical.
- **On-demand revalidation**: Manually revalidate data based on an event (e.g. form submission). On-demand revalidation can use a tag-based or path-based approach to revalidate groups of data at once. This is useful when you want to ensure the latest data is shown as soon as possible (e.g. when content from your headless CMS is updated).

#### 2.[Fetching data on the Server with third-party libraries](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#fetching-data-on-the-server-with-third-party-libraries)

#### 3.[Fetching Data on the Client](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#fetching-data-on-the-client)

If you need to fetch data on the client, we recommend using a third-party library such as [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) or [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest). 

### [2.Data Fetching Patterns](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/patterns)

#### 1.[Fetching Data on the Server](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/patterns#fetching-data-on-the-server)

#### 2.[Fetching Data Where It's Needed](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/patterns#fetching-data-where-its-needed)

This is possible because `fetch` requests are automatically memoized.

#### 4.[Parallel and Sequential Data Fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/patterns#parallel-and-sequential-data-fetching)

##### 1.[Sequential Data Fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/patterns#sequential-data-fetching)
